DEFINITION MODULE MouseCoords; (* Werner Winiger 1.11.80 

      The module MouseCoords allows you to read the current mouse buttons (b)
      and its position (x,y).

            Left button pressed    <=>   b = 1,
            middle button pressed  <=>   b = 2,
            right button pressed   <=>   b = 4.

      A window may be defined for clipping the mouse's movement to a block of
      the display. (cf. DEFINITION MODULE Screen) The mouse coordinates are
      then wrapped around that window and computed relative to it.
      After a call of SetMouseWindow, GetMouse returns the same mouse position
      as just before (in the previous window).

      The procedures SetMouse and MoveMouse enable you to assign absolute coordinates
      to the current mouse position or to add relativ ones to it respectively.      *)
