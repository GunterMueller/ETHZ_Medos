2.1.  Getting Started
+
The computer is switched on by pushing the 1red power switch0 on the cabinet.  Before any further action is done, the 1reset button0 at the 2rear0 of the keyboard must be pushed!  This is very important to set the computer quiet and therefore to prohibit uncontrolled actions.

As soon as the 1white disk switch0 lights up, the square, black 1disk cartridge0 may be inserted into the disk drive.  Afterwards, push the 1white disk switch0 on the cabinet (to start the disk) and the 1reset button0 at the 2rear0 of the keyboard (to set the computer ready for a bootstrap).  Finally, hit the 1space bar0 or CTRL-A on the keyboard.

As soon as you hear a short, clicking noise, the disk is ready for operation, and the bootstrap of the computer is started.  The resident operating system Medos-2 is loaded from the disk.  After successful loading, it first displays a 1version number0 in the top left corner of the screen.

3Sometimes a bootstrap is not successful the first time, i.e. the version number does not appear.  In this case retry the bootstrap: Push the reset button again and hit the space bar or CTRL-A.0

The operating system now makes some initializations.  If everything is all right, a 1dot0 appears behind the version number.

3It is possible that there appears an error message instead of a dot.  This indicates that something may be wrong with the computer or with the disk cartridge.  Chapter 13 describes what to do in this case.0

The 1command interpreter0 now displays a version message.  Afterwards, the command interpeter displays the date of the last use of the disk cartridge and prompts for the current date.
= x25
 old date = 25.8.81
 new date >
+
The new date is expected in the same format as shown by old date, whereby only the changed numbers must be specified.  The input of the new date is terminated by hitting the RETURN key or the 1space bar0.  Hitting only the RETURN key means that the old date is still valid.  After the date is accepted, an asterisk 2*0 is displayed.  The command interpreter is now ready to accept the name of a program which should be executed next.  How programs are called is described in chapter 3.

1For advanced users:0  The disk cartridge contains two so-called 1boot files0.  According to the key pressed when a bootstrap is started, one of these files is loaded into the memory.  File 7PC.BootFile0 is read when the space bar is pressed, and file 7PC.BootFile.Back0 is read when CTRL-A is typed.  This allows to substitute, 2with utmost care0, a different bootstrap program.  Boot files are linked in an absolute format and cannot be executed like other programs.  They are generated by a special bootlinker program.

2.2.  Exchange of the Disk Cartridge
+
If you want to work with another disk cartridge, you have to exchange it.  First, be sure that an asterisk was last displayed, i.e. the command interpreter is active to accept a program name.  Afterwards, switch off the disk (white disk switch) and wait until the disk has stopped.  This is signalled by a light on the disk switch and by a short clicking noise.  Now, the disk cartridge in the disk drive may be replaced by another one.  Restart the disk by pushing the white disk switch again.

While the disk cartridge is exchanged, usually the image on the screen disappears and you will see the "Ghost of Lilith" wandering around the screen.
+
As soon as the disk is ready again, the ghost disappears and the operating system is caused to make some reinitializations.  This "soft bootstrap" is important because the operating system stores some information about the loaded disk cartridge in the memory.  The reinitialization is indicated by the version number and the dot on the top left corner of the screen.  Finally, an asterisk 2*0 is displayed and a program name is accepted again.

If the disk cartridge is exchanged during execution of a program, this exchange will not be detected by the operating system and therefore 1no reinitialization0 takes place.  In this case a real 1bootstrap0 of the computer is 1mandatory0 (see 2.1.).  Otherwise, there might arise problems with the disk cartridge sooner or later.

2.3.  Termination of a Session
+
For termination of a Lilith sesson, exchange the disk cartridge with the grey 1dummy cartridge0 (do not restart the disk).  The dummy cartridge is very important to protect the disk drive from dust.

The computer may now be switched off with the red power switch.  This, however, is not necessary if somebody else wants to work with the machine.  In this case leave it in the waiting state, or start the program 7HardwareTest0 before switching off the disk.  This program will use the idle time to run some checks on the computer's hardware.
